# cost_effective_analysis
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files analyzing the costs of methods A and B. The methods are compared based on their static costs, reductions, and cumulative costs, providing insights into cost-effectiveness.

Following Python programs are used for result visualisation:
1. Static costs Method A, B | Costs/trio
2. Static costs Method A, B | Per trio cumulative cost
3. 5-fold reduction Method A costs + Static cost Method B | Per trio cost
4. 5-fold reduction Method A costs + Static cost Method B | Per trio cumulative cost
5. 5-fold reduction Method A costs + 2-fold reduction Method B costs | Per trio cost
6. 5-fold reduction Method A costs + 2-fold reduction Method B costs | Per trio cumulative cost
7. Static costs Method A, B | Cumulative costs for the UK newborn population
8. 5-fold reduction Method A costs + Static cost Method B | Cumulative costs for the UK newborn population
9. 5-fold reduction Method A costs + 2-fold reduction Method B costs | Cumulative costs for the UK newborn population
